# Markdown Demo Web Application

This static web application renders a predefined Markdown file (`input.md`) into HTML using the `marked` library. It highlights code blocks with `highlight.js` and displays the result within the page.

## Features
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap 5
- Markdown parsing with `marked`
- Syntax highlighting with `highlight.js`
- Error handling for rendering issues

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
- Click the "Load Markdown" button to render the Markdown content.
- The content is loaded from the embedded `input.md` content within the script.

## Notes
- The application uses embedded JavaScript; no backend or server is required.
- The markdown content is hardcoded but can be modified in the script.

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap 5
